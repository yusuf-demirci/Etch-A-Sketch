# Etch-A-Sketch

This is a sketch pad that's prepared by HTML-CSS and JavaScript. There are 3 modes you can use, color mode, where you can select any color from a color picker,
rainbow mode, where you can draw colorfully and randomly and last eraser mode. Also you can rearrange the resolution from 4x4 to 64x64.
